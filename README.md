* Rhonda was the team lead.
* Nastassia and Sinovia traded off driving and navigating.

    * We did some serious busting out of our html homepage and styling with extreme professionalism.
    * We began creating app.js and controller.js page.
    * We began making calls to our etsy api.  "It is working!"
    * We laughed, sang and ate snacks when appropriate.
