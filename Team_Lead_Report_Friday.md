TRENDING PAGE

MB was team lead for Friday.  Although Jordan created a factory on Thursday night for storing our API call data, we decided to set it aside, since we were spending a lot of time researching error messages and trying to get it populated with data.  Once we focused on a standard API call, we had pretty steady success. After we made a successful API call, the bulk of our afternoon was devoted to getting the images on the Trending page to display properly.  Jordan drove, while Kaitlin and I navigated and researched what we learned is called a masonry layout.  In the end, it took a magical combination of CSS styling gleaned from our search efforts and a bit from Etsy's site.  It looks terrific!

Over the weekend our goals are:

*  get lazy load to work
*  add a More button at the bottom of the page, so visitors can load even more trending items
*  add 3 components that appear on hover over item listings( add to favorites icon, share with friends icon, and "See similar items..." link)
*  add a "tooltip" style modal displaying the product's full title that appears with a one second delay on hover over product image
*  create a functional drop-down navbar submenu
*  capture the listing id to send to the Product page team
